# User Story:
  - User wants to publish a popular food journal, but does not know which food photos to choose from a wide range of photos. This system helps user to select the most appealing food photos for userâ€™s reference. 

# Introduction:
- Google NIMA paper[1] mentions evaluating photos esthetically with AVA esthetic photo gallery[3]. Another paper[2] shows that to train a model to evaluate food photos, one only needs to use a few AVA food photos to have successful results. So this project uses 5000 AVA food photos as dataset.
# Requirements:
  - Python 3
  - TensorFlow

# Training:
1. Download [AVA dataset](https://github.com/mtobeiyf/ava_downloader)
2. Download [Slim VGG16 pre-trained model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim). These CNNs have been trained on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS image classification dataset.
3. Training code will be released soon.
# Evaluation:
1. Download [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16eK7ByJi1zV68v7OS6LKshDlll-AeSpj/view?usp=sharing)  or self-trained model.
2. Run below instruction and the program will load all the photos in dataset for esthetic evaluation. <br />

```python3 evaluate_nima_vgg16.py --photo_dir= <path to photodir> --vgg16_path= <path to vgg16>```

# Resullt:
  - Esthetic score of 5 or above means successful photo. Lower than 5 means not so good. Tested the model with 500 AVA food photos and confirmed the accuracy is up to 73.5%, which matches the result of the paper[2].
# To-Do List:
  - Downsize the file of model with MobileNet
  - Create Web version with Tensorflow.js
